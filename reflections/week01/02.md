## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
   they're more specific forms of classes that can be used to modify standard classes. Pseudo classes that I would be using regularly are ":visited, :hover, :checked".

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
   The higher specificity, the more detailed you need to be when targeting the class.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
   Your specificity could get confusing and you could run into a lot of walls and style changes that you can't immediately identify the problem with.
