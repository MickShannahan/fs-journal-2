## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
To give yourself an idea of where you want to go with your project, while also being able to make different variations quick and cheap
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
Low-fidelity, which is good for quick rough ideas before picking one to put more resources in. mid-fidelity, which is a good all purpose wireframe, that is still quick to make, but gives a better understanding of what you are trying to propose. High-fidelity, which is good for the final stages of wireframes, when you have a clearer idea of what you want to make.
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
Sketching something out before committing to something is always good. It's better to go into any project having an idea of what you want to do, instead of coming up with things on the fly.
